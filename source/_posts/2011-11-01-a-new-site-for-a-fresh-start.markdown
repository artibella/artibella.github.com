Oh hello! Welcome to my new site. After years of building websites for other people, I finally got my act together and created my personal space on the internet.

Starting next year I will leave the world of web agencies seeking for new opportunities and challenges in the digital universe and I am very excited about it! This site will help me to document my new experiences along the way. I will try to share my thoughts and knowledge on development and design, UX, music and whatever else comes to my mind.

## The geeky facts about the site

This site uses [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress"), a blogging framework for hackers, which is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), a static site generator written in Ruby.

The nice thing about building a website for yourself is that you can use all the shiny new tools and techniques that the modern web has to offer. So I took a "mobile first" approach and created the responsive design in the browser using SASS and the Compass Framework for the CSS.
