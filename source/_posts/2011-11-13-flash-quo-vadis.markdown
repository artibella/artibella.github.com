Wow, what a crazy week in the Flash world that was! First Adobe announced huge layoffs &mdash; 750 people, mostly from Flash related teams. Later they revealed that the Flash player for mobile devices and tablets will be discontinued and that they will put more resources into HTML5 and the AIR runtime for mobile. And when I checked my Twitter feed on Saturday morning I was surprised to find out that also the Flex SDK will be contributed to the Apache Foundation as an open source project after the 4.6 release and Adobe is offloading the future development of the framework to the community.

While I do agree with the direction Adobe is heading, I think terrible mistakes where made in communicating these changes, especially to their developer community, which will most likely speed up the demise of the Flash platform in the next years.

## Flash and me

My history with Flash started way back in 1999/2000 after I decided that I want to build things for the web as my career choice. Especially I was highly fascinated by the ground breaking Flash sites and games that were popping up all over the net. So I read books about Flash 4, HTML and JavaScript and was lucky to land a job in the industry creating Flash games and animations. Back then the browser wars were in full effect and with all the browser inconsistencies I quickly realized that I could not build the kind of interactive work I wanted to create with HTML/JS and focused my career on Flash and Macromedia Director. I was so fed up with HTML that I even swore to myself to never work with HTML again &mdash; how naive I was at that time...

Years passed, the Flash player kept pushing the boundaries of interactive content on the web and also web standards evolved but in a much slower pace. With the advent of XHTML and CSS2 I overcame my early bias towards HTML and embraced the potential of semantic structured documents and the new styling possibilities which came with CSS. With JavaScript frameworks (like Prototype, JQuery or Mootools) it even became fun to write JS again. But when it was necessary to implement advanced graphical and technical features like audio and video playback, custom fonts, webcam access, socket connections, 3D, image effects and <abbr title="Rich internet applications">RIAs</abbr> the best way to achieve these goals across all browsers was to use Flash with its 99% install base among desktop computers.
