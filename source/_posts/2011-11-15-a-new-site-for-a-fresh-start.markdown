Oh hello! Welcome to my new site. After years of building websites for other people, I finally got my act together and created my personal space on the web.

Starting next year I will leave the world of web agencies seeking for new opportunities and challenges in the digital universe and I am very excited about it! This site will help me to document my new experiences along the way. I will try to share my thoughts and knowledge on web and mobile development, design, UX and whatever else comes to my mind.

## Some geeky facts about this site

The nice thing about building a website for yourself is that you can play with all the shiny new tools and techniques that the modern web has to offer.

This site uses [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress"), a blogging framework for hackers, which is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), a static site generator written in Ruby. It is hosted on Github using their [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/ "Github pages") feature. If you are interested in the source code you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/artibella/artibella.github.com/branches/source "Octopress source code of this website").

For the design I took a "mobile first" approach and created the responsive design entirly in the browser using SASS and the [Compass framework](http://compass-style.org/) for CSS and a modified version of the [320 and up framework](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/ "320 and up") for the markup.

I will save further the technical details for a future blog post where I'll go through my process of building this site and share some lessons learned.
