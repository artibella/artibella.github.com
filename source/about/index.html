			<h2>Flash, Flex and AIR development</h2>
			<div>
				<p>As an Flash oldschooler starting with Flash 4 in 2000, I followed its evolution over the years:</p>
			 	<ul>
					<li>from timeline code (remember <i>tellTarget()</i> &mdash; YUK!)</li>
					<li>to prototype programming in Actionscript 1 &mdash; a skill becoming usefull again for Javascript development</li>
					<li>to the introduction of real <abbr title="Object oriented programming">OOP</abbr> in Actionscript 2 and the use of design patterns</li>
					<li>to the stricted-typed event-driven sweetness of Actionscript 3 and the upcoming of great frameworks (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/" target="_blank">Flex</a>, <a href="http://www.robotlegs.org/" target="_blank">Robotlegs</a>, <a href="http://puremvc.org/" target="_blank">PureMVC</a>, Gaia, Away3D, ...)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Even though Flash had quite some bad press in the last years we must admit that it helped us build a richer internet that wouldn't have been possible using web standards. Now with HTML5 and CSS3 gaining great adaption in browsers we can offload most of the workload from Flash to the open web stack. 
				But there is definetly still a valid place for Flash in web development. Some projects still aren't possible or extremly complicated using HTML5/Javascript but easy to do in Flash. It's a great tool for interface mockups and interactive prototypes. And combined with Adobe AIR its a breeze to deploy apps to multiple platforms (desktop, mobile, web) using a single code base.
				</p>
				<p>As for me, I will keep Flash in my toolbox as it is still the best <a href="http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/" target="_blank">polyfill</a> for the web. But remember to choose the right tool for the job to serve your user the best possible experience and don't let your desicion be led by some tech flame wars.

			<h2>UX design and development</h2>
			<div>
				<p>You know this lovely feeling when you use software or websites that just work the way you expect it to, that looks and feels nice, never leaves you in the dark about what is happening, saves you time and that is so cool that you want to tell all your friends about it? Well, this is the kind of emotions I want to give the users of my work.</p> 
				<p>As a developer you have a great responbility for the overall user experience of your product. It's the developer who breathes life into the designs and scribbles and shapes the final result. But great user experience can only be achieved if the whole project team and workflow is user focused and it is my part, as a developer, to assist them with profound knowledge in UI design patterns, <abbr title="Interaction Design">IxD</abbr> and technical consulting.
