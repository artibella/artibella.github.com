    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh hello! Welcome to my new site. After years of building websites for other people, I finally got my act together and created my personal space on the web.</p>

<p>Starting next year I will leave the world of web agencies seeking for new opportunities and challenges in the digital universe and I am very excited about it! This site will help me to document my new experiences along the way. I will try to share my thoughts and knowledge on web and mobile development, design, UX and whatever else comes to my mind.</p>

<h2>Some geeky facts about this site</h2>

<p>The nice thing about building a website for yourself is that you can play with all the shiny new tools and techniques that the modern web has to offer.</p>

<p>This site uses <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a>, a blogging framework for hackers, which is based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator written in Ruby. It is hosted on Github using their <a href="http://pages.github.com/" title="Github pages">Github pages</a> feature. If you are interested in the source code you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/artibella/artibella.github.com/branches/source" title="Octopress source code of this website">Github</a>.</p>

<p>For the design I took a "mobile first" approach and created the responsive design entirly in the browser using SASS and the <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass framework</a> for CSS and a modified version of the <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/" title="320 and up">320 and up framework</a> for the markup.</p>

<p>I will save further the technical details for a future blog post where I'll go through my process of building this site and share some lessons learned.</p>
